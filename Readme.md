## Introduction

This is the supporting GitHub Repository for the article [Implementing a Toggle Switch in React JS as a Reusable Component](https://blog.praveen.science/) that I wrote to SitePoint. We are going to create a toggle switch (or that is what they call) using React JS and we will be using React components for this. In this article, we will see how to build a customised toggle switch component with React JS.

At the end of the article, we would have built a simple demo React App that uses our custom toggle switch component. When we are creating web applications, it usually involves working out the best for user interactions. One of the major ways of making provision for user interactions is through forms. Different form components exist for taking different kinds of input from the user. Here we will be looking at how to build an iOS inspired Toggle Switch control component.
